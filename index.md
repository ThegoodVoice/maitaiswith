    <p class="subheading">It started in 2014 as an idea (and a joke) in order to get a chance to interview Tom Hiddleston.</p>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/seaotta">Stephanie Stimac</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lindseyotta">Lindsey Otta</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/davidhoang">David Hoang</a> were, and still are, massive Hiddleston fans. At the height of the Marvel movies, there were a lot of interviews with Hiddleston and the three of them devised a concept that involved a beach, mai tais and interviewing celebrities.</p> 
    <p>While the celebrity portion of that never materialzied, Stephanie was determined to get the videocast off the ground, but more tailored to the area she, Lindsey and David all occupy: digital and tech.</p>
    <p>We'll explore and talk to people from all different corners of this space, all while sipping on Mai Tais, or their tropical drink of choice.</p>
