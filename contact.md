    <p class="subheading">It started in 2014 as an idea (and a joke) in order to get a chance to interview Tom Hiddleston.</p>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/seaotta">Stephanie Stimac</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lindseyotta">Lindsey Otta</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/davidhoang">David Hoang</a> were, and still are, massive Hiddleston fans. At the height of the Marvel movies, there were a lot of interviews with Hiddleston and the three of them devised a concept that involved a beach, mai tais and interviewing celebrities.</p> 
    <p>Every year since, Stephanie would somewhat hopefully bring up #MaiTaisWith and it remained a far off dream. While the celebrity portion of that never materialzied, Stephanie was determined to get the videocast off the ground, but more tailored to the area she, Lindsey and David all occupy: digital and tech.</p>
